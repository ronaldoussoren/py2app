Py2app Configuration
====================

Introduction
------------

As of py2app 2.0 the primary way to configure a build is using
configurration in ``pyproject.toml`` (as introduced in
`PEP 518  <https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/>`_).  Note that
py2app is not a build system as described in PEP 518, using
py2app as the ``build-backend`` in  the ``build-system`` table is
not supported and will result in an error.

Configuration for py2app is stored in the ``tool.py2app`` table.

A basic example of a configuration file:


.. sourcecode:: toml

   [tool.py2app.bundle.main]

   script = "main.py"
   semi-standalone = true


The configuration for bundles supports defining multiple bundles,
but for now only a single bundle is supported. The convention is
to use ``main`` as the subkey for the primary bundle.

Global options
--------------

The options can also be included in the ``bundle`` configuration described
below, and generally have a command-line equivalent as well.

============================ ================= ===========================================================
Key                          Value Type (TOML) Description
============================ ================= ===========================================================
``build-type``               string            The type of build, one of:

                                               * ``standalone`` (default): Create a bundle that can be used
                                                 on a different machine.

                                               * ``semi-standalone``: Create a bundle that embeds all resources
                                                 except the python interpreter

                                               * ``alias``: Debug builds that links to source files instead
                                                 of copying them into the bundle.

                                               ``arm64`` or ``universal2``). Defaults to the architecture(s)
                                               of the Python interpreter.

                                               Defaults to the set of architectures of the active
                                               interpreter.

Bundle configuration
--------------------

Configuration for a bundle can contain the following keys:

============================= ================= ===========================================================
Key                           Value Type (TOML) Description
============================= ================= ===========================================================
``name``                      string            (Optional) Name of the bundle (without
                                                extension). Default is same as the
                                                basename of ``script``.

``script``                    string            Path to the main script.

                                                the dot). Defaults to ``app`` for
                                                application bundles and ``bundle``
                                                for plugin bundles.

                                                the dependency checker.

                                                Note that packages will only include the
                                                package itself and anything found relative
                                                to the package ``__init__``.

``exclude``                   array of string   Array of modules or packages that won't
                                                be included even when detected by the

                                                that will be included, even if not
                                                detected by the dependency checker.

``dylib-exclude``             array of string   Array of shared libraries and frameworks
                                                that will not be included.

``plist``                     table             Contents for the ``Info.plist`` file,
                                                will be merged with a py2app template.

                                                For simple programs this can can be left
                                                out.

``chdir``                     bool              Change directory to the "Contents/Resources"
                                                folder. Defaults to ``true`` for application

``argv-emulator``             bool              Fill ``sys.argv`` by waiting for open events during
                                                startup. Defaults to ``false``.

                                                This option can only be used for application bundles,
                                                and should not be used with GUI frameworks (which generally
                                                have their own mechanism for handling open events).

``argv-inject``               array of string   Values that will be appended to ``sys.argv`` during startup

``emulate-shell-environment`` bool              Emulate the environment variables from a Terminal window
                                                by running a login shell in the background and extracting
                                                environment variables. Defaults to ``false``.

``extra-scripts``             array of string   Additional script that should be included in the bundle,
                                                will be setup for command-line invocation.

``redirect-to-asl``           bool              Redirect the stdout and stderr streams to Console.app using
                                                ASL. Defaults to ``false``. Deprecated, do no use.
============================= ================= ===========================================================

For now only a single bundle is supported. In the future there will be support for multiple bundles,
including embedding bundles (e.g. an application with embedded plugins).


Code signing configuration
--------------------------

Configuration for code signing is stored in the
``tool.py2app.codesign`` table. And can be stored in
a ``codesign`` subtable for specific bundles.

This section is intentionally left blank.


Recipe configuration
--------------------

Configuration for the recipe system is stored in the
``tool.py2app.recipes`` table. And can be stored in
a ``recipes`` subtable for specific bundles.

                                               in ``site-packages.zip``. Please file an issue with py2app
                                               for distributions on PyPI that are not zip-safe.

                                               PyQt or PySide. Defaults to an empty array.

``matplotlib-backends``      array of string   The matplotlib backends to include for scripts using
